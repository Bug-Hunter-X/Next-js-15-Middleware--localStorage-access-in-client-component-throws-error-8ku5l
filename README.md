# Next.js 15 Middleware: localStorage access in client components

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Next.js 15's Middleware feature.  The problem arises when attempting to access `localStorage` within a client component that's rendered after the middleware has executed.  This often results in unexpected behavior, including errors and incorrect data.

## The Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to read user data from `localStorage`.  If the middleware isn't set up correctly, the `localStorage` access might fail because the middleware runs on the server, while `localStorage` is client-side.

## The Solution

The solution involves ensuring that client-side code properly handles cases where `localStorage` may not be immediately available (e.g., on the server during middleware execution).  This often means adding checks to verify `localStorage` existence and handling cases where it's null or undefined.
